I publish some of my slides on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/UmbertoPicchini). I also have a [research blog](https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/).

My research is about statistical inference for stochastic modelling, typically stochastic dynamical systems. That is, given a model representing mathematically the time-evolution of a system subject to random noise, I am particularly interested in the estimation of the relevant unknown model-parameters using available data.
Most of my research is focused on how to deal with models not admitting readily available analytic expressions to perform inference. Therefore, my main interest at the moment is to construct ways to deal with models having _intractable likelihoods_. This usually implies building probabilistic algorithms based on different types of Monte Carlo strategies.

I am particulary interested in Bayesian methods, inference for state-space models and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with applications to biomedicine. More specific interests are: accelerating MCMC computations for Bayesian inference; mixed-effects modelling for SDEs; approximate Bayesian computation (ABC); stochastic modelling for tumor growth, protein folding and glycemia-insulinemia dynamics.

I have received a research grant from the Swedish research council for the interdisciplinary project "Statistical Inference and Stochastic Modelling of Protein Folding" ([here is an accessible description](http://www.maths.lu.se/index.php?id=85411)) for which I am the principal investigator, in collaboration with [Kresten Lindorff-Larsen](http://research.ku.dk/search/?pure=en/persons/174843) (Copenhagen University) and [Julie Lyng Forman](http://biostat.ku.dk/staff_/?pure=en/persons/164838) (Copenhagen University).
