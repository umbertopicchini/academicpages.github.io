This is the personal page of Umberto Picchini. As of May 2018 I am Associate Professor in Mathematical Statistics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

On this site you will find several ways to contact me and follow my research.

Let's [get in touch](contact) to talk about **biomedical modelling**, statistical inference (especially **Bayesian**), **likelihood-free** methods, and **Monte Carlo** statistical methods.
