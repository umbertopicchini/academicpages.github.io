This is the personal page of Umberto Picchini. As of 1st May 2018 I am Associate Professor in Mathematical Statistics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

On this site you will find several ways to contact me and follow my research.

Please [get in touch](contact) to talk about biomedical modelling, statistical inference (especially Bayesian), likelihood-free inference, and all Monte Carlo statistical methods.
