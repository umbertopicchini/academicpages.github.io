This is the personal page of Umberto Picchini. As of May 2018 I am Associate Professor in Mathematical Statistics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

On this site you will find several ways to contact me and follow my research.

Let's [get in touch](contact) to talk about **biomedical modelling**, statistical inference (especially **Bayesian**), **likelihood-free** methods, and **Monte Carlo** statistical methods.

**News**
- I will participate to [ISBA 2018](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/) in Edinburgh, including the satellite workshop on [ABC](https://sites.google.com/view/abc-in-edinburgh/), June 24-29.
- New paper with Samuel Wiqvist and Julie Forman: "Accelerating delayed-acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms", [arXiv:1806.05982](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05982).
