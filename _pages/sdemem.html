Hi, this page is still incomplete and not meant for public search. However, now that you are here, this is intended to host a list of references to 
so called "stochastic differential mixed-effects models" (SDEMEMs). SDEMEMs are hierarchical models for population estimation, with dynamiocs driven by stochastic differential
equations.
