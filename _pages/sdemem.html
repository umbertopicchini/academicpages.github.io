Hi, this page is still incomplete and not meant for public search. However, now that you are here, this is intended to host a list of references to 
so called "stochastic differential mixed-effects models" (SDEMEMs). SDEMEMs are hierarchical models for population estimation, with dynamiocs driven by stochastic differential
equations. The reason for compiling a list of resources is that publication in this area is sparse. So having a list of references can be handy for the uninitiated reader.

  - The oldest SDEMEM paper I am aware of. Also, notice that in an <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00285-003-0257-z">older paper</a> the same authors write
  <i>"A mixed-effect PK/PD modelling framework as implemented in
NONMEM [1] is not considered since the theory for hierarchical PK/PD modelling
using stochastic differential equations has not been developed."</i>
