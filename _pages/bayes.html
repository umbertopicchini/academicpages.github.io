I am very interested in researching computational methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian inference</a>. For example approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (aka particle filters) for Bayesian inference.
<br><br>
These interests are reflected in my <a href="/pages/publications.html">publications</a> and my <a href="https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/">blog posts</a>.

<b>Bayes Nordics</b><br>
To ease information on events related to Bayesian methods, data analysis and practice, I have created <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bayesnordics/">Bayes Nordics</a>. This is a distribution-list that focusses on Bayesian events, activities and job-posts in the European Nordic countries (just because I happen to work in a Nordic country).
