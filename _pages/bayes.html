I am very interested in researching computational methods for Bayesian inference. For example approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), Markopv chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (aka particle filters) for Bayesian inference.

These interests are reflected in my <a href="publications.html">publications and my <a href="https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/">blog posts</a>.
