I am very interested in researching computational methods for Bayesian inference. For example approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), Markopv chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (aka particle filters) for Bayesian inference.

These interests are reflected in my <a href="publications.html">publications and my <a href="https://umbertopicchini.wordpress.com/">blog posts</a>.

To ease information about events related to Bayesian methods, data analysis and practice, I have created <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bayesnordics/">Bayes Nordics</a>. This is a distribution-list that focusses on events and activities in the European Nordic countries (just because I happen to work in a Nordic country).
