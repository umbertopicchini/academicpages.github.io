I define the "Xi'an's number" as the number of papers authored by a researcher that have been discussed on Christian P. Robert's <a href="https://xianblog.wordpress.com">blog</a>.
<br>
"Discussion" of a paper implies that said paper is the main topic of a blog-post, not just a brief mention/reference.
